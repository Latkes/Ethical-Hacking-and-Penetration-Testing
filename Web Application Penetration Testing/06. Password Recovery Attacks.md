# Password Recovery Attacks
 
# What is Spidering or Crawling?
* A web spider/ web crawler is an **automated script** which browses the World Wide Web in a **methodical, automated manner.** This process is called **Web crawling or spidering.**
* Burp suite would create various sub-folders as and when it encounters them while accessing website.

# Your First Pasword Recovery Attack 
# Step 1: Identifying already existing username
## Step 1: Logging in OWASP Goat and Selecting Attack Type
* You can view **Spider Status** and **number of bytes transferred** under **spider submenu** in BurpSuite.
* Goto **OWASP and click on OWASP goat and enter credentials** to commence the attacking proceedure. **Credentials** for logging in to OWASP Goat would be **webgoat** both as username and password. Now click on **Start Webgoat.**
* In the left side-menu, you can see various **types of attacks** that can be performed in OWASP. For password recovery attack under **Authentication Flaws, chose Forgot Password** attack type.

## Step 2: Understanding Intercept and Intruder Tabs of BurpSuite
* The **Intercept tab** is used to **display and modify HTTP and WebSockets messages/packets** that pass between your browser and web servers.
* Following are some **important actions** can be done with **intercept tab** -
   * **Forward** - When you have **reviewed** and (if required) **edited the message/packet**, click **Forward** to send the message on to the server or browser.
   * **Drop** - Use this to **abandon message** so that it is not forwarded.
   * **Interception is on/off** -
        * This button is used to **toggle all interception on and off**. 
        * If the button is showing **Intercept is on**, then messages will be **intercepted/automatically forwarded** according to the configured options for interception of HTTP and WebSockets messages. 
        * If the button is showing "Intercept is off" then all messages will be **automatically forwarded.**

* **A BurpSuite Intruder** works by taking **an HTTP request** (**base request**), modifying request in **various systematic ways**, issuing each modified version of the request, and **analyzing the application's responses** to identify interesting features.

## Step 3: Positions and Payloads
* **Under Positions tab, Payload Positions** is used to **configure request template** for attack, **together with payload markers**, and **attack type** (which determines the way in which payloads are assigned to payload positions).
* **Under Payload tab,** load the username dataset by clicking on **load button.**
* Migrate to following path - `/usr/share/wordlist/metasploit/http_default_users.txt` and load dataset. Click on **start attack.**
* When you migrate to **results tab**, you can see BurpSuite has tried logging in to OWASP Goat site using list of usernames loaded in previous step.
* To each username tried, we see a corresponding column **Length**, which is the response length (for e.g. *username doesnot exist* ).
* In the screenshot, we see length of one response *admin* is different from rest of the responses.

## Step 4: Logging in to OWASP using *Valid Username*
* Select the username that had a **different response length** from step-3 and input in the text-box.
* Now, you have successfully cleared **first stage of password recovery attack.**


# Step 2: BruteForce Attack with BurpSuite
## Step -1: Click on OWASP Bricks 
* Instead of OWASP Goat, we migrate to **OWASP bricks** to prepare for brute force attack.
* After OWASP Bricks, click on **login pages** and migrate to **login page #3.**

## Step -2: Capturing Entered Username and Password
* Open BurpSuite and login page side-by-side.
* Enter any random username and password and switch-off the intercept after hitting submit button.
* Capture the POST request made for Login page #3 in BurpSuite under target tab.

## Step -3: Setting Attack Type to Cluster Bomb
* Search for the response string **Wrong user name or password.** in response's html code.
* Migrate to payload tab and select attack type as Cluster Bomb, since now we have to add 2 user inputs instead of 1.
* Highlight username field and click on Add button to insert `usernames.txt` file. Repeat the same for passwords.

## Step -4: Grep Matching
* Under Options tab, search for Grep-match option.
* Grep-match is used to flag result items containing specified expressions in the response. 
* Add the exact response string which was displayed in the login page and start the attack.

## Step -5: Start the Attack
* BurpSuite now performs brute-force attack using the list of usernames and passwords.
* Every combination has coressponding column with response string.
* This column has a check box.
   * If this check-box is checked, it implies the username and password combination was wrong.
   * If this check-box is un-checked, it implies username and password combination is valid.
