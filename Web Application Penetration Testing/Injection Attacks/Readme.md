# Injection Attacks

## Overview 

Injection attacks refer to a broad class of attack vectors. In an injection attack, an attacker supplies untrusted input to a program. This input gets processed by an interpreter as part of a command or query. In turn, this alters the execution of that program.

## Reasons behind Injection Attacks
* User's input is not properly filtered out.
* Website might interpret user's input as part of code. E.g. SQL queries in JavaScript code.
